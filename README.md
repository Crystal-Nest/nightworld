## **Description**
Explore the Nigthworld, a similar world to the Overworld, but it's always night and beds explode!  
It's a perfect choice for both multiplayer servers who need the nighttime but can't coordinate many players and for single players in search of a more challenging Overworld!

## **Features**
- Enter the Nightworld TODO
- Required only server side!  
- For server admins, it's compatible with both Vanilla and modded clients!  
- Can be added to a server/single player world at any time!  
- Can be removed from server/single player worlds at any time!
